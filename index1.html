            <div>When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That easy. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Just relax and let it flow. That easy.

                    So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Let's get crazy.
                    
                    You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Isn't that fantastic? Happy painting, God bless. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.
                    
                    Imagination is the key to painting. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. A fan brush can be your best friend. Just make little strokes like that.
                    
                    All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. That's crazy.
                    
                    It is a lot of fun. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. We have a fantastic little sky! Don't fiddle with it all day. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.
                    
                    We don't have anything but happy trees here. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green.
