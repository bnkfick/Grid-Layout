You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Let's get crazy.</div>

                            <p>Imagination is the key to coding. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.

                                <p>All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Why does li list-style default to bullets? If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.

                    It is a lot of fun. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. We have a fantastic little sky! Don't fiddle with it all day. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.

                        We don't have anything but happy trees here. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do.

                    side now. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Maybe there's a happy
                    little Evergreen that lives here. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. That's crazy.
